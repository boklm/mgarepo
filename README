mgarepo is the tool used to manage RPM packages in a subversion repository
on Mageia. It is a fork of the repsys tool used by Mandriva.
It is used to create, tag releases, generate .src.rpm, generate changelog,
and request new package releases for build. It mostly acts as a interface
to svn(1) commands and small task scripts run that on the build system side
over ssh(1).

For more information, see mgarepo(8)

The discussion on the development of mageiarepo takes place on the
Mageia developers mailing list.
